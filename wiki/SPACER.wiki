(in chronological order)

    * Community: The Android and iPhone communities appear to be growing at a much larger pace than the Nokia community of developers because of the signing issue.
    * Other high impact features that are not in the originally selected Nokia phone(N95) such as digital compasses etc.
      * DFF: Agreed to the change to Android OS, based on above reasons.  Agreed by
