= Project Description =
  * 10 second elevator pitch (how do you sell this to an early adopter?): Historically, a student or researcher conducting fieldwork was only able to search for datasets relevant to their study sites after downloading data from their mobile devices into a computer back at their laboratories. SPACER aims to develop mobile software that improves the process by enabling repositories to be searched whilst the student or researcher is still out in the field. The project will develop a demonstrator prototype that enables mobile phones with built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to query repositories supporting standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) - a global group of over 380 private, public and academic organisations (http://www.opengeospatial.org).

    * only using "spacer" tag will need to make sure to use JISC tag with 'spacer' tag so it is uniquely identifiable for crawler. 
    * core success factors: a.)  downloading of project files(or source code) on the Sourceforge project, b.) announcement of the project demonstrator on the community mailing lists and related events.

== Correspondance ==
(in chronological order)
  * meeting (Tuesday 23rd June) with the BGS and Edina in order to finalise the use case and requirements for SPACER
    * Participants: Tyler Mitchell(OSGeo), Stuart Marsh (BGS), Joe Vernon(Edina), Gobe Hobona(CGS), Mike Jackson(CGS), Andrew Chamberlain (ComSine 1Spatial)
  * 2009-06-24 request for late start date (from June to August) to hire student CS dev assistant
    * DFF: Agreed so long as risk assessment (plan A, B and C) in case student isn't available.
    * DFF: Want budget of contributions from other org (Edina) into project
  * 2009-06-29 GH: adopting Google Android instead of Nokia Java ME, although the proposal mentioned Nokia Java ME.
    * Signing: There is self-signing support in Android but Nokia requires applications to be signed with certificates from VeriSign, Thawte or Geotrust. Certificates cost at least $400 and are valid for a year. Signing is needed because we intend access both http and location capabilities of the phones.
    * Usability: HTC/Google Android phones have bigger screens, touch interfaces and generally better usability.
    * Community: The Android and iPhone communities appear to be growing at a much larger pace than the Nokia community of developers because of the signing issue.
    * Other high impact features that are not in the originally selected Nokia phone(N95) such as digital compasses etc.
      * DFF: Agreed to the change to Android OS, based on above reasons.  Agreed by
