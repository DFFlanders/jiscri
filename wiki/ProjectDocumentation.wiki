= Intro to Project Documentation =
All JISC projects are *required* to complete documentation.  This is not only to justify the spending of public money but to also help inform the JISC in future funding decisions.  Most importantly documentation is there to help spread best practice amongst our community and to help you to effectively plan the work you want to achieve. For the Rapid Innovation Programme we have attempted to scope all documentation so you can directly see the benefits that documentation has for yourself and for the community as a whole.

In short, the 'Rapid Innovation' projects are of a different project species, and so we've changed the way documentation works so that it is lightweight and web-worthy.  Overall we hope it gets you writing documentation for one another, rather than just to the JISC executive.

Below is a list of documentation you will need to complete so as to fulfil your remit to the JISCRI programme.

= JISCRI Project Documentation Templates =
There are four sets of documents you will need to complete during the course of your JISCRI project:

  # Project Planning (Core Project Resources Form, Project Plan and Project Budget)
  # Progress Posts (including a list of themes and tags for you to post about via blog)
  # Final Budget Report (official summary of how the money was spent)
  # Final Project Sign-Off (including programme survey and legal completion of project)

==Project Planning==
  # [http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=cG84ZHFaX0d1TmY1UTJmZDAweHI5Vnc6MA.. Core Project Resources Form] <- please fill out within first fortnight of the project.
    * This form is gathering the key URIs in your project so that JISC can support you as effectively as possible in monitoring your project.  
    * For example by having all the project blog feeds we can aggregate them into a central feed so we can more effectively pass on news and developments as they occur to other JISC projects.  
    * This form is essential and needs to be filled out as soon as you have your staff, website/blog/wiki, code repository and rss feeds in place.
  # [http://docs.google.com/View?id=ddpd4q4q_21g5vg5zfx Project Plan Template]  <- please complete within the first month of your project.
    * This document clearly states the obligation you have to JISC in how you plan to achieve your project.  
    * This document can be cut and paste from your project proposal so long as nothing has changed with the budget.

*_Please remember all documents you create as part of your project are subject to FOI so best to maintain best practice with regards to transparency and openness throughout your project_*

==Progress Posts==
  * So as to make your life easier we are suggesting a series of blog posts be written for the project as it progresses (this is in place of the final completion report so should save you time)
  * The posts are intended to disseminate the knowledge of the project in the now, rather than waiting until the end of the project to share your experiences. 
  * In short, we would like you to write a blog post on the following themes during the course of your project, though you are welcome to find variance in the theme as you see fit.  We are not prescriptive here and really want you to write something that people in the community will want to read, i.e. don't write them for JISC alone.
  * Please make sure to use the correct tags for each post so that our robots can come along and aggregate all posts on various topics into our analytics tools (manyEyes, Google Data, etc).  We are hoping this open data approach helps increase the synchronous-ability in which we communicate with one another.
  * The posts can be as short or as long as you like so long as you keep your fellow projects and Higher Education community audience in mind.  
  * You must cover all the topic themes (and use all the tags) below be that in ten separate posts or in three or four longer posts (though our preference is for early and often where possible).

The following topics make up the required Progress Posts (you can do these posts in the order you see as most pragmatic to your project).  

  # Project SWOTing: Undertake a basic [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis SWOT analysis] of your project (which is a good thing to repeatedly do with yourself when you have a couple free moments waiting for a bus or train, especially helpful at the end of code sprints).  The key is to truly knowing thyself or at least your project. 
  # User participation: what is the core user case(s) you think of when developing the app; how has this story changed as you have engaged with the end user e.g. "we often talk about lucy the mobile part time working student we met while at..." 
    * required tags = userCase, endUser, rapidInnovation, JISCRI, JISC, <your own project tag>, etc. 
    * required tags =  SWOT, rapidInnovation, JISCRI, JISC, <your own project tag>, etc.
  # How do you work on a day-to-day basis: what software tools or productivity methods do you use and how do you use them?  How do they make you more productive and why do you see value in using them?  Any and all tools, methodologies or diagrams showing off the way your project is run from an individual perspective are welcome.
    * required tags = methodology, implementation, productivity, rapidInnovation, JISCRI, JISC, <your own project tag>, etc.
  # Technical standards: what technologies, frameworks, standards or anything else that makes your life easier (or harder) in your work.  For example: what programming language (or framework, IDE, pattern, etc) do you use and why do you love it, e.g. "why I love Object Relational Mapping in Python and Django" or" why I think SWORD is great but could do this...", etc.
    * required tags = techStandards, technicalDevelopment, rapidInnovation, JISCRI, JISC, <your own project tag>, etc.
  # Value Add: What was the more important thing you discovered that brought value to your project, e.g. what was the "wow" moment that made you change your perspective on a specific technology or process.
    * required tags = valueAdd, disruptiveInnovation, rapidInnovation, JISCRI, JISC, [your own project tag], etc.
  # Small WIN(s) & FAIL(s) <- perhaps use twitter for this?: announce small wins for the project, e.g. when you finish a coding sprint or when a user has a 'wow your software is cool' moment.  The more of these short "win" posts the better!  Also don't forget to post the FAIL(s) as well: telling people where thing went wrong so they don't repeat mistakes is priceless for a thriving community.
    * required tags =: "WIN" or "FAIL" and "JISCRI"
  # Final Progress Post
    * <This is a special post that will have criteria and template added to it so please watch this space as your project is getting closer to the end>

==Final Project Budget and Sign-Off==
  # Final Budget Template (everyone must fill this out) <!--link coming soon-->
    * Please note that the final budget will be made open under FOI regulations so do not put any personal data in the budget, e.g. instead of listing names of people please list their their general role in the project: "project manager", "project developer", "consultant developer", etc.
  # Final Project Sign-off Form <!--link to final report coming soon-->
    * To complete the project you will need to fill out the above form.  This is both the legal ending of your project and the feedback JISC requires to improve on rapid innovation the next time around.
