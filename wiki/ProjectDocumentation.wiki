= Intro to Project Documentation =
All JISC projects are *required* to complete documentation.  This is not only to justify the spending of tax payer money but to also help inform the JISC in future funding decisions.  Most importantly documentation is there to help spread best practice among the HE community and for the Rapid Innovation Programme we have attempted to scope all documentation so you can directly see the benefits that documentation has the community as a whole.

Even if you have done a JISC project before, the processes continues to change (alongside the technology) so you will need to read over the [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/funding/project_management/projectmanagementguidelines.pdf project guidelines], *however* we have changed some of the documentation requirements for the JISCRI projects.  In short, the 'Rapid Innovation' projects are of a different project species, there are some amendments we have made so as to embrace a more lightweight and webworthy documentation process.

Below is a list of template documents you will need to fill out.
