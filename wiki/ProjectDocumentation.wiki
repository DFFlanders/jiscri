#summary This page lists the documentation JISCRI projects are required to submit.

= Intro to Project Documentation =
All JISC projects are *required* to complete documentation.  This is not only to justify the spending of tax payer money but to also help inform JISC in it future funding decisions.

Even if you have done a JISC project before, the processes continues to change (alongside the technology) so you will need to read over the [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/funding/project_management/projectmanagementguidelines.pdf project guidelines], though we have changed some of the documentation requirements for the JISCRI projects.  In short, the 'Rapid Innovation' projects are of a different project species, there are some amendments we have made so as to embrace a more lightweight and webworthy documentation process.

Below is a list of template documents you will need to fill out.  

= Project Documentation Templates =
We have provided both the official Word document template form and a XHTML formatted (including microformats!) templates below.  You are of course welcome to use the word documents, but would also welcome the use of an open standard such as XHTML.  So as to make the XHTML document wordprocessor friendly, we've formatted them as Google Docs templates so you can copy & paste them into a Google Docs to edit them there with their user friendly WYSIWYG :)

  # Progress Reports: So as to make your life easier (and ideally enable you to write documentation for all those potential users on the World Wild Web), we are requesting a series of project progress blog posts (instead of the reports).  In short, we would like you to write a blog post on the following themes (making sure to use the correct tags):
    * TBC SWOT Analysis? <- please make sure to use tags: "swot", "jiscri", "jisc", "[your own project tag]", etc.
    * TBC Methodology? <- more info soon, check back.
