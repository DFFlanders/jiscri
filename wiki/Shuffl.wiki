= Project Description =
  * 10 second elevator pitch: Creating an easy-to-use web-based data and information management and publication environment, using as its theme a visual metaphor based on record cards, mimicking the use of physical cards in existing information handling tasks.  Our goal is a system with a user interface that is easily adopted by researchers and others who are uninterested in the intricacies of data management, but whose work involves the creation of valuable data resources.
