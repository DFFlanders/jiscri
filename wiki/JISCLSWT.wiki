= Project Description =
  * Project name: Library Social Widgets Toolkit

  * 10 second elevator pitch: 
    * The aim of the project is to produce middleware and widgets that will allow users to check their library account, renew their books, pay fines, and review their reading lists from within a variety of social networking sites. Initially the widgets will plug into Moodle, Facebook, and iGoogle, so that users can access the services they want from the social sites they use.
