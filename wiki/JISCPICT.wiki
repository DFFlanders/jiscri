= Project Description =
  * Full Name of Project (project tag is name of this page): Platform Independent Community Toolbox
  * 10 second elevator pitch (how do you sell this to an early adopter?): This project proposes to develop a working prototype of a lightweight distributed community-centric set of collaborative tools (commenting, tagging, annotating and bookmarking) for use on any given online resource. Our earlier project SNEEP built such tools for the Eprints repository and has been adopted by those in the the EPrints community. Broadening the scope of the tools developed by SNEEP will in turn engender the creation of valuable community networks of collaboration and communication based around the existing resources used by that community.
  * Twitter description (120 characters laymen description, e.g. how would you describe this to your neighbour and not bore them): Collaborative research tools: for the community, owned by the community, available where the community is.
  * Questions this project answers (end user problems it solves):
    * User Question (what itch does it scratch):
    * Community Question (how does this change the way things were done):
