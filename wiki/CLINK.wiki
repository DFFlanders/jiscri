= Project Description =
  * Full Name of Project (project tag is name of this page): Concept Linkage in Knowledge Repositories (CLINK)
  * 10 second elevator pitch (how do you sell this to an early adopter?): Knowledge repositories proliferate at an accelerating rate and While these offer excellent support for specific information searches, there is limited support for unstructured browsing or semi-structured information gathering, when a user does not know what there is to know (but wants to find information connecting known concepts). This project will build a tool for semi-structured searching of knowledge repositories based on finding previously unknown concepts that lie between other concepts. 
  * Twitter description (120 characters laymen description, e.g. how would you describe this to your neighbour and not bore them): Knowledge repositories search and visualisation tools
  * Questions this project answers (end user problems it solves):
    * User Question (what itch does it scratch):
    * Community Question (how does this change the way things were done):
