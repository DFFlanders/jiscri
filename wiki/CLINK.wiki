= Project Description =
  * Full Name of Project (project tag is name of this page): Concept Linkage in Knowledge Repositories (CLINK)
  * Long: Knowledge repositories proliferate at an accelerating rate and While these offer excellent support for specific information searches, there is limited support for unstructured browsing or semi-structured information gathering, when a user does not know what there is to know (but wants to find information connecting known concepts). This project will build a tool for semi-structured searching of knowledge repositories based on finding previously unknown concepts that lie between other concepts. 
  * Short: Knowledge repositories search and visualisation tools
