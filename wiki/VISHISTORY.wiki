= Project Description =
  * Full Name of Project: Visual History Project
  * Long Description: Visual History is a project proposal to address the on-line visualisation and retention of data and assets that are produced by students while undertaking a research project in History, and is applicable to a wide range of related subject areas.  The project will define a structure of “History items” to enable “views” of the project linking items by use of a map, timeline, or through other attributes.  This will form the basis of a display board metaphor.
  * Short description: Visual History is a project to address the on-line visualisation and retention of data and assets that are produced in a group history project
