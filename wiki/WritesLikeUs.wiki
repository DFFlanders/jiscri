What questions does the project answer?
  * Do you need people to sit down and declare social networks or can a machine automatically suggest that network (the ties that bind) for you?

====SWOT:====
  * Strengths:
    * existing resources ready to be exploited for social network data <- Intute IRS dataset
    * We need to be able to recognise scholarly networks
  * Weaknesses:
    * requires data throughput and compute time to process
    * mathematically intensive experimentation with algorithms 
    * precision (++) vs. recall (-)
  * Opportunities:
    * Could be a game changer for delivering scholarly resources to the right scholarly social networks
    * Some relations should be exposed of networks (~40%) and potentially more (~%60?)
  * Threats:
    * Minimal staff time to devote to complex problems in algorithm adjustment 

====Workpackage-Sprints====
list out the top three most immediate code sprints to be done along with an effort required rating 1-5 (i.e. little effort = 1 : good deal of effort = 5)?

  # Ascribe data to person: assign scholarly profile index to a name (X1)
  # Find unique data points for each person <- names, ldap, etc. (X3)
  # Test algorythm social network lasso (X5)
  # Create widget to show academic social network (X2)

names and a quick biog for a handful of end user currently involved in the project?

preference for managing the project, e.g. prince, waterfall, agile, scrum, etc.

potential business cases for making the stuff creating viable in the long term, e.g. how do you see the project resources being funded beyond the life of this project?
