  * 10 sec pitch: The writeslike.us project explores the question of generating metadata about individuals and their likely community memberships. It is a practical development project for development of a prototype repository enhancement service and sample interface, proposing candidate community participation information from analysis of existing documents & metadata. 

  * Two sentence project pitch: match.com for researchers

  * What question does the project answer?
    * Do you need people to sit down and declare social networks or can a machine automatically suggest that network (the ties that bind) for you?
