Actions:
  * Go over Core project info: uniquely identifiable web tag for the project!!!
  * Sign off on ProgManger SLA: please sign in the comments section of ServiceLevelAgreement page

===SWOT analysis:===

Strengths:
  * Synergy with national strategies OER
  * Works for most people most of the time
  * (x1) user friendly, ease of use
  * Cost of implementation
  * Rapid production with minimal technical expertise
  * Automation of publishing process
  * Open Access
  * TechDis endorsement
  * IT IS FREE!
  * Already have a user community
  * Separation of concerns in code: xml backbone vs run time ? <- Is there a programming pattern being used, e.g. MVC, RMR?

Weaknesses:
  * Timescale - 5 months
  * small number of partners (content generation)
  * Trying to serve too many customers (bespoke vs generic)
  * Lack of awareness of open content?
  * Academic buy in, getting people to use it, using eLearning more generally
  * Fear of publishing openly <- culture of change
  * credibility of being a Nottingham product <- market posititon
  * Written in ActionScript

Opportunities:
  * Completion date in September (short)
  * Dissemination at ALT
  * Rich content can attract new distance learning audiences: team teaching including international, adult learners, hospitalised learners, Jorum-haters...
  * cross referencing like Amazon <- other users have liked this resource
  * Legal requirement for open learning license
  * FE communities
  * National Standard for HE content creation?
  * DDA or DED legislation for legal requirements in Accessibility requirements
  * ongoing funding and potential funding
  * using it for staff development: teach the teachers
  * Training events
  * get international recognition
  * Try before you buy <--! is it easy to install? political battles to get it installed (digital signature for exe?)

Threats:  
  * (x1)Commercial competition
  * Summer Holiday
  * Timeliness for engaging academic staff and learners
  * Customer perception of e-learning
  * Repository fatique
  * Open Learn competition
  * Reusuable learning objects becoming fragmented
  * Overhead of supporting multiple users
  * list out the top three most immediate code sprints to be done along with an effort required rating 1-5 (i.e. little effort = 1 : good deal of effort = 5)?
  * names and a quick biog for a handful of end user currently involved in the project?
  * preference for managing the project, e.g. prince, waterfall, agile, scrum, etc.
  * potential business cases for making the stuff creating viable in the long term, e.g. how do you see the project resources being funded beyond the life of this project?
  * misuse of tool by others <- how tool can be used
  * multimedia content integration: skills of lecturers 
  * future funding, sustainability

how academic publishes?
* opt in / opt out : publish
* Q/A process

<--! is there a clickable tick and take down policy? -->

Notes:

* beta prototype 
* set of tools for developers:
** actionscript open source
* 200 developers on mailiing list: 
* 3000 hits
** toolkits atop language: form fill

Audience: Further Education
Moodle and Xerte on a stick <- xerte toolkit on a USB

Last Friday of the month have a online tutorial, supoprted by tech Dis, 

code sprints:
* installed in other institutions
* aggregatre RSS feeds: 

user install toolkit, after install asks to submit to repository -> RSS push -> [entity] -> push items into Repository 

Sprint: push to repository
