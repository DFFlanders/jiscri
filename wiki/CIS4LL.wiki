  * 10 second elevator pitch (how do you sell this to an early adopter?): The Cloud Bank project aims to build a mobile- and web-based crowd-sourced information system to help international students share their knowledge and understanding of the local language and culture. The system allows students to collect, annotate and tag language- and culture-related content found in everyday life, including text, images and other media, and to share these content items with other language learners.

  * Questions this project answers:

    * Community Question (how does this change the way things were done):
