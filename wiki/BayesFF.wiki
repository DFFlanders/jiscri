= Project Description =
  * Full Name of Project: Personalising Alerts with Bayesian Feed Filtering
    * Tag: bayesff
  * Long: The Bayesian Feed Filtering (BayesFF) project aims to allow individual researchers to identify those articles that are of interest to them from a set of RSS feeds of Journal Tables of Content by applying the same approach that is used to filter out junk emails. The project will implement a RESTful API for an existing open source feed aggregation and filtering package; investigate whether the filtering is effective enough to be helpful to users; and disseminate information about the potential of this approach within the JISC community.
  * Short: Developing a service to filtering RSS feeds to catch the stuff you're interested in.
