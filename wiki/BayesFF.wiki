= Project Description =
  * Full Name of Project (project tag is name of this page): Personalising Alerts with Bayesian Feed Filtering
  * 10 second elevator pitch (how do you sell this to an early adopter?): The Bayesian Feed Filtering (BayesFF) project aims to allow individual researchers to identify those articles that are of interest to them from a set of RSS feeds of Journal Tables of Content by applying the same approach that is used to filter out junk emails. The project will implement a RESTful API for an existing open source feed aggregation and filtering package; investigate whether the filtering is effective enough to be helpful to users; and disseminate information about the potential of this approach within the JISC community.
  * Twitter description (120 characters laymen description, e.g. how would you describe this to your neighbour and not bore them): Developing a service to filtering RSS feeds to catch the stuff you're interested in.
  * Questions this project answers (end user problems it solves):
    * User Question (what itch does it scratch):
    * Community Question (how does this change the way things were done):
