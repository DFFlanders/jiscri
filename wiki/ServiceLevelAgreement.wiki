#summary This page describes the SLA of the Programme Manager to each individual project within the programme.

= Service Level Agreement =

The following is a list of things that the Programme Manager is likely to consult upon for each project (please note: each individual programme manager has a different style of management and so a request for any one of these services should be made rather than expected):

  # Primarily the job of the Programme Managers is to know the primary product (output) the project is producing, be that code, reports or guides.  Once the Programme Manager can effectively describe the project they can then feedback to JISC, ergo encourage future funding innovation!  
    * To be pragmatic, you should know that JISC with over ~200 hundred projects on the go at any time which usually means a programme manager only have about 120 characters to explain what your project is producing; so, helping you construct a brief synopsis of your project is essential for me in promoting the projects existence.  
    * Though the above should not be confused with the overall primary aim and audience of the project which should be to the end user, NOT JISC.
  # The general metaphor for what a programme manager does can be surmised as a "lightning rod": existing in the HE/FE ether so as to try and take advantage of the patterns across all the projects (in the clouds) and bring their ideas down to earth so we can organise around the good ones as a community (the other analogy is that of a "symbiotic communal organism", but that is not as cool as a "lightning rod" <zap!> ;-)
    * I am interested in WINS and FAILS equally and of course there is "no penalty for learning" (personally I feel the fails are more valuable for the community than the wins most times).
    * Help me help you, by feeding back small WINS and FAILS: a quick email, a quick tweet, a quick skype IM, etc.  Please celebrate the small victories and learned failures by letting me know!
  # A programme manager must audit the accomplishments of the project via supporting documentation.  The most laborious part of the Programme Manager's job is keeping track of the documentation projects are _*required*_ to produce throughout the life of the project.  To help make this easier, I've summarised the ProjectDocumentation on the wiki.  
    * Deadlines for project documentation will be articulated well in advance of the due date.
    * Communication on expected delivery of project documentation is required (if you are late with any documentation notice should be early and often!!!)
    * _Failure to actively communicate with the Programme Manager on documentation can result in stoppage and even pulling back of your funding._ <- please make my life easy by just staying in touch!
  # A programme manager will attempt to organise events around common patterns and nodes that emerge over the course of the project.
    * Ideas for event welcome, especially if you can provide a free venue! ;-)
  # Support projects by providing advice on: development practices, IPR, evaluation techniques, dissemination plan and business case (sustainability) strategy. 
  # Last but certainly not least is the essential service of helping create a community, which of course requires the wisdom of crowds so we can find commonalities to exploit!  Again, any ideas for how to enable shared commonalties between communities is greatly appreciated (and please do think outside of the JISC community box, there is a World Wild Web out there to utilise!).  

= Chronological examples of service rendered by Programme Manager to individual projects =

From a typical 6 month project the following can be expected from the Programme Manager:
  * A F2F visit to the host project institution to meet the project team (project manager, developers and bonus points if we can meet a real end user!)
  * A Programme Meeting with all projects in attendance
    * You usually get a nice meal out of it, let alone the networking opportunities :)
  * Updates on when ProjectDocumentation is due
  * Support for any project events of significance
    * On particular interest are events that involve actual end users
    * Any multi-developer gathering: talkShop, barcamp, pair-programming, etc.
  * On call (twitter, skype, email, etc.) support on any queries.
  * Attendance at final project event
    * Meetings with senior management
    * Final evaluation lunches 
    * Software launch events
