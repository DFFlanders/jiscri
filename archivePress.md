# Project Description #
  * Full Name of Project (project tag is name of this page): ArchivePress
  * 10 second elevator pitch (how do you sell this to an early adopter?): ArchivePress is a blog-archiving project that will explore practical issues around the archiving of weblog content, focusing on blogs as records of institutional activity and corporate memory. As an alternative to the web crawling/harvesting approach of the Internet Archive and the UK Web Archive, ArchivePress will test the viability of using RSS feeds and blog APIs to harvest blog content (including comments, embedded content and metadata). The archived content will be stored and managed using instances of Wordpress, thereby maintaining the blogs’ native data structures, formats and relationships.
  * Twitter description (120 characters laymen description, e.g. how would you describe this to your neighbour and not bore them): ArchivePress: a testbed for creating blog archives by harvesting blog newsfeeds and using WordPress to store the results
  * Questions this project answers (end user problems it solves):
    * User Question (what itch does it scratch):
    * Community Question (how does this change the way things were done):
