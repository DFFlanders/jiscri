# Project Description #
  * Full Name of Project (project tag is name of this page): The Mobile Internet Detective
  * Long: The Intute "Mobile Internet Detective" project is already positioned as an extremely popular, well respected online tutorial, helping the user to assess the academic validity of websites. The project intends to build on the existing service by extending its reach to include mobile users, who, as the mobile Internet has developed, have come to expect higher standards when browsing on their handsets. The needs and behaviour of a mobile surfer differs greatly from a desktop surfer, so ‘ The Mobile Internet Detective ’ will deliver a user friendly mobile site that is fast and inexpensive to load, providing the right content, presented in the right order and with an adapted layout.
  * Short: This project aims to develop a prototype mobile version of the Internet Detective online tutorial and consider other methods of content delivery such as via podcast.
