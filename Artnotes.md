# Project Description #
  * Long Description: Artnotes is an iPhone application aimed at students in fine art, photography and other visually orientated disciplines. The application allows users to collect images and textual notes on the device in a format analogous to a traditional “Visual notebook” as used in many branches of arts education. The application will be able to take visual input from the device’s camera as well as being able to search online image collections.
