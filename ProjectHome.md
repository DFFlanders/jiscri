This site and wiki is for the JISC Rapid Innovation Programme.

Please see the [JISC website](http://jisc.ac.uk/aboutus.aspx) for details on what JISC is about and how to get involved.  Also see the links on the right side of this page.  Or please feel free to contact [David F. Flanders](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/contactus/staff/davidfflanders) with any questions.

### How to use this site? ###
You are on the "Project Home" page/tab (which is really the "Programme Home" by JISC terminology but nevermind) this page describes the overall Programme status, the other tabs/pages have the following information:
  * **Downloads**: any downloads that the programme manager wants to pass to projects or any items that the project want to pass one another.
  * **Wiki**: This will primarily be a place where the programme manager will keep notes on the various processes projects should carry out as well as general notes on what is going on with each project.  Otherwise, it is a a sandbox where anyone can come and create a page, the programme manager will highlight pages via a table of contents (ToC) page below.

# Why "Rapid Innovation" #
I think my colleague (Andy) does a pretty good job of explaining why we should be doing 'rapid innovation' at JISC:

# What Projects Make Up the "Rapid Innovation" Programme? #

The following are lists of the projects in various groupings:

  * [Project funded from the 12/08 Call](http://code.google.com/p/jiscri/w/list?q=label:Call-12.08) (should be finishing in November 2009)
  * [Projects funded from the 03/09 Call](http://code.google.com/p/jiscri/w/list?q=label:Call-03.09) (should be finishing in December 2009)

## Why a code repository as a Programme web site and wiki? ##
I'm hoping to model best practice for project in regards to "publishing early and often", accordingly I'm hoping to support projects as the programme manager by running the programme the way that I think a project should be run (used to be a project manager myself and can't quite let go!); though I would encourage you to run your project as an individual and feedback to me so I can do a better job myself ('wisdom of crowds' right!).

## Who is the audience for this site? ##
There are three expected audiences for this website (in order of significance):
  1. "You the Project Manager" so you can find out what you should be doing at various stages in the project (and what/how other projects are doing).
  1. "The Powers That Be" aka the money holders and auditors so they can have an overall view of how the money is being spent.
  1. "Other Developers" can come and see what significant code I think is cool (since I like to get my hands dirty with the code myself).

## DISCLAIMER ##
As with almost everything I do, this is an experiment and so feedback is greatly appreciated.  I have a monitor set on all the comments areas, so feel free to send opinions that way (if you want a response make sure to make me aware of the handle you are using).
